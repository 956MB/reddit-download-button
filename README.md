The browser extension that I've always wanted for Reddit... download buttons for easily saving images within posts. It's exactly what a data hoarder needs! *Does not require Reddit login.*

## Features

- Adds buttons to Reddit posts and inside galleries for easy one-click downloads
- Separate ZIP download button for downloading all images in a folder
- Supports downloading single images, entire image galleries, and GIFs
- Works on both the Reddit feed and individual post pages
- Detects the highest resolution version of images for download

>[!WARNING]
> Currently the extension doesn't work on inline videos due to some `m3u8` thing I couldn't get to work. Please feel free to help with an [issue](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/pulls).
