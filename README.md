# Reddit Download Button

![Reddit Image and Video Downloader](./img/screenshot.png)

The browser extension that I've always wanted for Reddit... a download button for grabbing all the images within a post. It's exactly what a data hoarder needs! *Does not require Reddit login.*

>[!NOTE]
> Currently the extension doesn't work on videos due to some `m3u8` shenanigins I couldn't get to work. Please feel free to help with an [issue](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/pulls).

## Features

- Adds a download button next to the share button on Reddit posts
- Supports downloading single images, image galleries, and GIFs
- Works on both the Reddit feed and individual post pages
- Detects the highest resolution version of images for download

## Supported Browsers:

>[!NOTE]
> The extension is primarily designed for Chromium-based browsers. Functionality in other browsers outside of these may be limited or require additional configuration.

#### Fixed

- Fixed posts containing video player or embedded video links incorrectly being given a download button.
- Also fixed GIF posts not being detected as a single image and download not working.
- Resolved issue where only 10 images could be downloaded from posts containing more than 10 images. Implemented batch processing with a short delay between batches to comply with Reddit's rate limiting while allowing download of all images in a post.
