The browser extension that I've always wanted for Reddit... download buttons for easily saving images within posts. It's exactly what a data hoarder needs! *Does not require Reddit login.*

![Reddit Download Buttons Post](./img/post.png)

</div>

## Features

- Adds buttons to Reddit posts and inside galleries for easy one-click downloads
- Separate ZIP download button for downloading all images in a folder
- Supports downloading single images, entire image galleries, and GIFs
- Works on both the Reddit feed and individual post pages
- Detects the highest resolution version of images for download

>[!WARNING]
> Currently the extension doesn't work on inline videos due to some `m3u8` thing I couldn't get to work. Please feel free to help with an [issue](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/pulls).

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out downloading m3u8 videos
- [ ] Add UI for extension settings
- [ ] Include metadata in ZIP file for the downloaded images/post (title, author, comments, etc.)
- [ ] Support downloading multiple inline images/videos from text posts
- [ ] Add download buttons to single images in comment sections.

## Known Issues

> [!NOTE]
- ZIP file creation not working when run from Tampermonkey. [Issue #2](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues/2)

## Changelog

[1.3.5](./CHANGELOG.md#135---2025-04-22) - 2025-04-22

##### Fixed

- [#7](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues/7) Fixed images not being downloaded at highest resolution due to incorrectly identifying the zoomable element. Downloads overall seem to be faster now with these changes (fingers crossed).
- Preview download button and others downloading from `i.redd.it` urls now uses `GM_xmlhttpRequest` (Tampermonkey only, unpacked extensions through chrome doesn't support or play nice with this) to bypass CORS.
- [#6](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues/6) Fixed images not having their correct extension when multiple extensions are present in the post. Like a `.gif` and a `.png`, default `.png` would be used for both.
- Not sure how or why, but maybe file previews in macOS are back to normal since we're downloading form the `i.redd.it` urls? Not even sure if this was script issue or a problem for other OS as well.

##### Removed

- Removed the installation instructions for manual "load unpacked" method. It doesn't play nice with the CORS policy of `i.redd.it` urls or the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function used by tampermonkey. It's just not the best way to use it.
- [#2](https://github.com/956MB/reddit-download-button/issues/2) Removed the ZIP download functionality because it's broken right now and I'm not sure how to fix it. Maybe will be added back if I add UI. Reduces tampermonkey script size by ~100kb, so that's a plus. Reference to #2.
